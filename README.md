- 👋 Hi, I’m @3ntes
- 👀 I’m passionate about advancing the energy transition, particularly exploring alternative and sustainable methods of energy production, transportation, and utilization, as well as understanding governmental incentives in this context. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications within the sustainable energy sector and beyond.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I am seeking collaboration on innovative business ideas in the sustainable energy sector. Currently, I am transforming an idea into a practical venture within the highly regulated niche of sustainable transportation energy in a European member state. The product can be transposed to other EU member states and Norther Americas. I am in search of a partner with expertise in software coding to contribute to this endeavor.
